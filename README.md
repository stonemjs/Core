StoneJS Core provides a simple and powerful environment to create any javascript projects, whether it is a simple project, a library, a backend, a frontend or a command line (CLI) application.

It provides a service container to manage your dependencies, an event manager to manage your events,
a kernel to run your application and an adapter to run your application in the appropriate environment (console, browser, http, Cloud, AWS Lambda, etc...).

All features are customizable, allowing you to easily extend them or include others.
